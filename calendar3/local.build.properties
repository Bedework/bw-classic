# This file gives sites the opportunity to override properties that will be
# defined later in the build process.
# The order of loading is:
#   <home-dir>/uwcal.build.properties
#   local.build.properties
#   <various other distributed properties>
#
# Therefore add site dependent overrides to this and individual developer
# overrrides to <home-dir>/uwcal.build.properties
#
# As distributed, this file contains properties that work for the quickstart
# release
